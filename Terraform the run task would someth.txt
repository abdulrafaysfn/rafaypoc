Terraform: the run task would something like this (a terraform resource basically)

resource "tfe_run_task" "log_transform_task" {
  name       = "Transform Logs to MongoDB"
  workspace  = "your-terraform-workspace-id"
  endpoint   = "https://your-endpoint-for-log-processing" # Lambda or API
  hmac_key   = "your-secret-hmac-key"
}
