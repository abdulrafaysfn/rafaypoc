Validation Report: DBMS Solution for Terraform Production Log Data (Metrics/Analysis)

Date: [Insert Date]
Prepared By: [Your Name]
Project: Terraform Apply Log Storage & Querying
Status: Validation Phase

1. Objective

The purpose of this validation report is to assess the feasibility, security, and performance of the proposed Redis-based DBMS solution for storing and querying Terraform Enterprise (TFE) apply logs from production. This validation ensures the plan meets business and technical requirements before moving to full deployment.

2. Summary of Decisions Made

2.1. Database Solution Selection
	â€¢	Final Decision: Use Redis for log storage and querying.
	â€¢	Reasoning:
	â€¢	MongoDB: Ruled out due to high costs and long onboarding process.
	â€¢	PostgreSQL: Considered but deprioritized due to slower deployment and query limitations.
	â€¢	Redis: Chosen for its high-speed querying, scalability, and existing internal use within Terraform Enterprise.

2.2. Infrastructure Deployment
	â€¢	Environments:
	â€¢	POC (Lower Lanes) â€“ for testing.
	â€¢	Production â€“ for actual log storage.
	â€¢	Server Allocation:
	â€¢	3 servers per environment (Total: 6).
	â€¢	Load balancer setup for high availability and accessibility.
	â€¢	Security Measures:
	â€¢	TLS-enabled Redis deployment.
	â€¢	LDAP integration for access control (if feasible).
	â€¢	Backup user authentication (DMP Analytics) if LDAP is not integrated immediately.

2.3. Log Ingestion & Querying
	â€¢	Log Source: Apply logs stored in S3.
	â€¢	Log Processing: Logs will be pulled from S3, transformed into Redis-compatible schema, and stored in Redis Streams for efficient querying.
	â€¢	Querying Needs:
	â€¢	Logs can be searched by RUN ID, Workspace ID, Timestamp, and Status.
	â€¢	Queries will be optimized for reporting and metrics generation.

3. Validation Criteria

The following criteria were evaluated to ensure the feasibility of the proposed solution.

3.1. Infrastructure Readiness

Criteria	Status	Details
Servers allocated	âœ… Yes	3 servers in POC, 3 in Production.
Load balancer setup	âš  Pending	DNS records and load balancer configuration needed.
Namespace allocation	âœ… Yes	Redis servers will reside in POC and Production namespaces.
ATAS onboarding	âš  In Progress	Expected completion: 2 weeks.

3.2. Security & Access Control

Criteria	Status	Details
TLS Encryption	âœ… Yes	Redis must have TLS enabled for secure access.
LDAP Integration	âš  Pending	If LDAP is not feasible, fallback user authentication will be used.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)	âš  Pending	Needs testing for granular access for different teams.

3.3. Log Ingestion Pipeline

Criteria	Status	Details
S3 API Access	âœ… Yes	Apply logs can be fetched from S3.
Log Transformation	âš  In Progress	Need to finalize schema for Redis storage.
Redis Storage Format	âœ… Yes	Using Redis Streams for structured querying.

3.4. Query Performance & Scalability

Criteria	Status	Details
Efficient Querying	âœ… Yes	Redis Streams allow querying by RUN ID, timestamps, status.
Query Complexity Handling	âš  Pending	Needs testing to confirm Redis performance under large datasets.
Scalability	âœ… Yes	Redis can scale by adding replicas if needed.

4. Identified Risks & Challenges

Risk	Impact	Mitigation
LDAP integration delays	Medium	Use DMP Analytics user for initial access control.
Query performance concerns under large loads	High	Optimize indexing, test with real data.
ATAS onboarding delays	High	Parallel processing of AD and Power Broker role setup.
Load balancer configuration delays	Medium	Request DNS records early in the process.

5. Next Steps & Recommendations

5.1. Immediate Next Steps

Task	Owner	Deadline
Finalize Redis deployment plan (including cluster setup)	[Your Name]	[Date]
Complete LDAP integration validation	[Security Team]	[Date]
Confirm log ingestion automation workflow	[DevOps Team]	[Date]
Validate Redis query performance under expected loads	[DB Team]	[Date]
Request and configure load balancer and DNS records	[Network Team]	[Date]

5.2. Final Go/No-Go Criteria

Before moving forward with full deployment, we must confirm:
	â€¢	Infrastructure readiness: Redis servers, load balancer, and ATAS onboarding completed.
	â€¢	Security validation: TLS enabled, LDAP authentication or fallback user configured.
	â€¢	Data pipeline validation: Log ingestion from S3 and transformation process confirmed.
	â€¢	Performance testing results: Queries perform efficiently under expected data loads.

Once these criteria are met, we can proceed with production deployment.

6. Conclusion

The validation process confirms that Redis is a feasible choice for storing and querying Terraform apply logs. While some components are still in progress (ATAS onboarding, LDAP integration, query optimization), the overall plan is viable with minor refinements.

Key Next Steps: Finalizing infrastructure setup, automating log ingestion, and testing query performance. If no major blockers arise, deployment will proceed shortly after Quartz go-live.
